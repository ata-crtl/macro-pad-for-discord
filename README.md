# Discord Macro Keyboard

A customdesigned discordmacro keyboard with complete PCB design. Features include ,discord shortcut keys for quick messaging and commands during gameplay or streaming.

## Why I Made This Project

I created this discord macro keyboard to streamline my discord experience during gaming sessions and streaming. Having dedicated physical buttons for common discord commands removes the need to alt-tab or memorize  keyboard shortcuts  allowing me to stay focused in-game while maintaining communication with my team and Community.
